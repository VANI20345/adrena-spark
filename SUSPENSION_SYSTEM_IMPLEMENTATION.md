## 📋 Configuration

### Edge Functions Config
Both new edge functions are configured in `supabase/config.toml`:
```toml
[functions.send-suspension-email]
verify_jwt = false

[functions.check-expired-suspensions]
verify_jwt = false
```

### Database Trigger
Auto-expiration trigger runs on every profile update:
- Checks if `suspended = true`
- Checks if `suspended_until` < now()
- Automatically clears suspension if expired

## 🎯 Next Steps for Admin

### 1. Set Up Cron Job for Auto-Expiration
To enable automatic suspension expiration, set up a cron job in Supabase:

```sql
-- Run every hour to check for expired suspensions
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'check-expired-suspensions',
  '0 * * * *', -- Every hour at minute 0
  $$
  SELECT net.http_post(
    url := 'https://nzuppbjtxmfrgutyagev.supabase.co/functions/v1/check-expired-suspensions',
    headers := '{"Content-Type": "application/json", "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY"}'::jsonb
  ) as request_id;
  $$
);
```

**Steps:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Database → Extensions
2. Enable `pg_cron` extension
3. Enable `pg_net` extension
4. Run the SQL above in SQL Editor

### 2. Configure Email Service (Optional)
To send actual emails when users are suspended:

1. Sign up for Resend: https://resend.com
2. Verify your domain: https://resend.com/domains
3. Create API key: https://resend.com/api-keys
4. Add secret in Supabase:
   - Go to Edge Functions → Secrets
   - Add `RESEND_API_KEY`
5. Update `send-suspension-email` edge function to use Resend
