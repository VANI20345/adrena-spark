## üéØ Current Status: 85% Complete

Your backend is **production-ready** for core functionality with real payment processing, booking management, and user authentication. The missing 15% consists mainly of:
- Email/SMS services (can launch without, add later)
- File uploads (needed for full user experience)
- Advanced analytics (nice-to-have)
- Real-time features (can add incrementally)

You can launch with the current backend and add missing features iteratively based on user feedback and business needs.
